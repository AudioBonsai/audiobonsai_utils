Let us know your favorite before we record Thursday evening via Twitter, Facebook or our website at AudioBonsai.com or leave us a voice mail telling us who you are and what your favorite is at 952-22-AUDIO.  That's 952-222-8346. If you have your pick to us by Thursday night when we record we can work it into the show.  Get it in by Sunday and we can probably duct tape it in awkwardly somewhere.  Monday or later, we can have a nice chat while you listen to what could have been. We hope you found something to love in this episode and we'll see you again next week. \n"

We'll be playing samples of our favorite songs from the list of 60+ Moksha created Tuesday morning from EPs and LPs released this week. We have just emerged from our forced isolation while we individually compiled our personal top tens.  The Calculatron 3000 combined those into an overall top 10 using the most advanced scoring metric known to this podcast.  We’ll be playing samples of the songs we selected as we discuss them, but when the show is posted to AudioBonsai.com all of the songs we talk about will be embedded in their full glory. If you’d like to participate in the show yourself, stick around until the end and we’ll give you the details on how you can get your voice into our podcast.\\n\\nAnd now with a little help from our friends, the Hit Meters, we’ll go over our honorable mentions.  Our honorable mentions are songs that appeared at least one of our top 10 lists, but didn’t make the combined top ten.\\nHM and the Hit Meters\"\n",

Let us know your favorite before we record Thursday evening via Twitter, Facebook or our website at AudioBonsai.com or leave us a voice mail telling us who you are and what your favorite is at 952-22-AUDIO.  That's 952-222-8346. If you have your pick to us by Thursday night when we record we can work it into the show.  Get it in by Sunday and we can probably duct tape it in awkwardly somewhere.  Monday or later, we can have a nice chat while you listen to what could have been. We hope you found something to love in this episode and we'll see you again next week. \""
